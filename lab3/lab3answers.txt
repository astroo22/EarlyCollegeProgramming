q1: In camel case the first letter in the first word of a variable is lower case then every begining letter of a new word after the first is capital.
q2: In a class name the first letter of the first word is capitalized while in a variable it is not.
q3: Equal with the above block. for instance if its and if statement the braces will go be directly in line with the if.
q4: Because if we do not use proper indention then reading and error debugging is a complete and utter nightmare and anybody else who sees it will chastize you.
q5: ALL_CAPS with an underscore inbetween words
q6: 0.0 1 and 0
q7: A, C, E 
q8: a=int b=int c=int d=double e=double
q9: As things get more complicated its very easy to find exceptions to what works and what doesn't from a primitive type and therefore it will become necessary for someone to create a custom class that can handle what needs to be done.
q10: classes are more like a template and objects are more like a specific thing. ( I feel like this is a trick question...)
q11: Static variables will share one copy of that variable with every instance of that class while a non static variable creates a different copy of each variable for each instance of the class.
q12: 
		public static int totalCarsManufactured;
		public string carModel;
